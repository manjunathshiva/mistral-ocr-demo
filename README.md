## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation guide for Mistral OCR, a state-of-the-art document understanding API. The included notebook demonstrates practical techniques for extracting, analyzing, and querying information from complex documents using Mistral's powerful OCR capabilities.

## What is Mistral OCR?

Mistral OCR is an advanced Optical Character Recognition API that sets a new standard in document understanding. Unlike traditional OCR solutions, Mistral OCR comprehends each element of documents—text, tables, equations, and images—with unprecedented accuracy and contextual understanding.

Key advantages include:

- **State-of-the-art document comprehension**: Process complex layouts, tables, and mathematical expressions
- **Native multilingual support**: Process content in 11+ languages with exceptional accuracy
- **Superior performance metrics**: 94.89% overall accuracy across benchmark tests
- **Remarkable processing speed**: Process up to 2000 pages per minute on a single node
- **Document-as-prompt functionality**: Query documents with natural language
- **Self-hosting options**: Available for sensitive information requirements

## Repository Contents

- `Grade4_MistralOCR.ipynb`: Primary implementation notebook demonstrating Mistral OCR usage
- `README.md`: This documentation file
- Additional example files and resources

## Implementation Guide

The notebook in this repository demonstrates:

1. **Setup and Installation**: Installing required packages and initializing the Mistral client
2. **Document Upload**: Loading and processing PDF documents
3. **URL Generation**: Creating signed URLs for document access
4. **Query Construction**: Formulating effective queries for information extraction
5. **Response Processing**: Handling and formatting the extracted information
6. **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processing multiple documents (optional)
